# angular-intro

This is an example of a very simple [Angular](http://github.com/angular/angular) application generated with [Angular CLI](http://github.com/angular/angular-cli) which uses the Meetup API to show the concept of components and services using Angular, I've created it to do a lecture about it on [CaquiCoders](https://www.meetup.com/CaquiCoders).

You can check it live on [this link](https://alefesouza.github.io/angular-intro).
